A Tauri desktop app that simulates Discord-detectable game activity using lightweight runner executables. This repository includes the refreshed desktop interface, updated packaging flow, and a guided usage tutorial for end users.

## Overview
Discord Quest Automation helps you test or simulate game activity without downloading full game files. The app is centered around verified Discord-detectable game metadata and provides a focused dashboard for searching games, launching lightweight runner processes, stopping them cleanly, and checking status from one place.

## Releases
To download the packaged app or source code, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/msxfury/Discord-Quest-Completer-v1.0/releases/tag/2026-v.1.1.0) page.

## Video Tutorial
A full usage walkthrough is included in this repository for users who want to watch the process before running the app.

- Watch the tutorial video here: [Discord-Quest-Automation.mp4](assets/tutorial/Discord-Quest-Automation.mp4)
- Video path inside the repo: `assets/tutorial/Discord-Quest-Automation.mp4`

The tutorial is useful if you want to see:
- how to launch the app
- how to search for a Discord-detectable game
- how to add a game to the dashboard
- how to use the available actions
- how to verify status behavior during use

## Important Notes
- The current production target is Windows.
- Frontend development can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- The runner workflow is currently Windows-focused.
- Use RPC-related features carefully. Depending on use, they may violate Discord terms or platform rules.
- Always extract packaged ZIP releases fully before running the desktop executable.

## Features
- Search and add detectable Discord games
- Simulate game processes with lightweight runner binaries
- Manage start and stop actions from a dashboard UI
- Use a modern dashboard with clearer visual hierarchy and improved status visibility
- Run an optional RPC test flow for activity simulation
- Use packaged Windows releases without needing to open the source in an editor

## Updated Design and Backend Integration
This project includes a major UI/UX refresh and backend/integration updates completed by [msxfury](https://github.com/msxfury).

### Design Updates
- Reworked the app into a modern dark SaaS-style dashboard with stronger visual hierarchy.
- Redesigned the header, search area, game list, game actions panel, status surfaces, and empty states.
- Improved readability using better spacing, typography scale, contrast, alignment, and panel separation.
- Added smoother interaction feedback such as hover states, focus states, transitions, and stronger action emphasis.
- Standardized visual tokens including colors, glow language, border radii, and panel treatment for a more consistent interface.
- Updated branding assets and icon usage across the desktop experience.

### Backend and Integration Updates
- Applied integration-level updates to keep the Tauri + frontend workflow stable.
- Updated runner/resource wiring and icon synchronization for desktop runtime consistency.
- Resolved startup/build path issues that affected local execution and packaged output behavior.
- Improved packaging structure for release ZIPs so users receive only the files needed to run the app.
- Added supporting reliability fixes while preserving existing core functionality and command behavior.

## What This App Does
Discord Quest Automation works by pairing a desktop UI with lightweight runner executables. Instead of requiring full game installations, it allows you to work with Discord-detectable application metadata and launch lightweight process simulations through the packaged Windows runner.

This project is mainly useful for:
- testing the desktop flow
- checking Discord-detectable game metadata behavior
- validating runner launch and stop actions
- exploring the interface and status handling
- educational or controlled testing scenarios

## Prerequisites
Install these first on any OS:
- Node.js 20+
- Rust stable toolchain
- Tauri prerequisites for your OS: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

Then enable pnpm via Corepack:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@8.15.3 --activate
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run frontend only

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Build frontend

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Desktop App (Tauri)

### Windows (supported)
Build the Windows runner and copy it into Tauri resources before running desktop mode.

```powershell
cargo build --release --manifest-path .\src-win\Cargo.toml
Copy-Item .\src-win\target\release\src-win.exe .\src-tauri\resources\src-win.exe -Force
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path .\src-tauri\target\release\data -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\src-win\target\release\src-win.exe .\src-tauri\target\release\data\src-win.exe -Force
pnpm tauri dev
```

### macOS and Linux (current status)
- Frontend development works with `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build`.
- Native runner behavior is currently Windows-focused.
- Tauri desktop experimentation is possible, but full runner parity is not yet implemented.

## How To Use The App

### Basic Flow
1. Launch the desktop app.
2. Search for a Discord-detectable game in the search bar.
3. Add the game to your active game list.
4. Select the game in the dashboard.
5. Use the available actions in the right-side panel.
6. Watch the status area to confirm the current state.

### What To Expect In The UI
- `Games` panel: shows added or active game entries.
- `Game Actions` panel: shows actions available for the selected game.
- `Status` card: shows whether the app is idle, connected, or running activity.
- `Test RPC`: allows you to test the RPC-related activity flow.

### Packaged App Usage
If you downloaded a packaged Windows release:
1. Extract the ZIP fully.
2. Open the extracted folder.
3. Keep `discord-quest-completer.exe`, `data`, and `resources` together.
4. Launch the main `.exe` from the extracted folder.
5. Do not run the app directly from inside the ZIP viewer.

## Game List Source
The app expects a bundled fallback file:
- `src/assets/gamelist.json`

You can populate it using Discord detectable applications endpoint data.

## Troubleshooting

### App shows localhost or cannot reach page
This usually means the wrong build output was launched or the app was not packaged from the proper release flow.

Recommended fixes:
- use the packaged release build, not a dev-only executable
- fully extract the ZIP before opening the app
- keep the executable and required folders together

### Port `1420` already in use
Stop the process using that port, then rerun.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$pid = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 1420 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty OwningProcess)
if ($pid) { Stop-Process -Id $pid -Force }
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
lsof -ti :1420 | xargs kill -9
```

### Rust toolchain not configured

```bash
rustup default stable
cargo --version
```

### Missing `resources/src-win.exe`
Re-run the Windows runner build and copy commands from the Windows section above.

## Project Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev              # Vite dev server
pnpm build            # Type-check + production frontend build
pnpm preview          # Preview built frontend
pnpm tauri dev        # Run Tauri dev mode
pnpm build:runner:win # Build runner binary (Windows)
```
